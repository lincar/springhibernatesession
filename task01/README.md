5. clone and run below sample program following given instruction in below URL, to test if your setup is all done.

6. Since we are working behind the firewall, we need to setup proxies for using github
Steps:
        a. store attached file as "gitProxy.bat"
        b. replace userName & password with your own user Id "user_user@persistent.co.in" and Password "@#pass@#"
        c. userId and password might contain special characters so we need to encode email Id & password for setting proxy (you may use below link).
            http://www.url-encode-decode.com/
                                e.g.
                                user_user@xyz.co.in     =>  user_user%40xyz.co.in
                                @#pass@#                       =>  %40%23pass%40%23
        d. run the above batch file before working with github through command prompt


7. Working with GitHub
        a.  Github account created
        b.  Github proxy sessions done and verification that they are working
        c.  Go to my repository " https://github.com/sunilkumargupta/springhibernatesession/tree/master/task01"
        d.  Follow the instruction given in task01. 
        e.  Above will lead you to one sample maven project, 
        f.  You'll have to follow the instruction given, just to verify & confirm if our setup is done and we are ready to move further.   
                                
8. repository "https://github.com/sunilkumargupta/springhibernatesession" is going to be our main repository and all have to be sync with it.
        a.  Go to above repository.
        b.  Follow the instruction given in README.md within the same.
        c.  It will help you forking my repository to yours and weâ€™ll keep our repository always in sync.
